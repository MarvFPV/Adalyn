36key QAZ-like handwired keyboard based on the great idea by somepin here on GitHub, check out his repo [here](https://github.com/somepin/qal-handwire)

Handwires of the keyboard are confirmed working, although we also have someone working on a PCB. 
Currently, the top and bottom are pretty much a friction fit, be aware of that when printing / ordering this case from a fab.

## Required components for handwires
* 36 MX style switches
* 2 2u MX platemount stabs
* 36 Diodes
* a Promicro
* one of ai03's [unified daughterboards](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Unified-Daughterboard)
* a few cables to wire up the matrix
* 4 m3x6mm screws
* 4 m3x8mm countersunk screws

I personally tend to remove the microUSB connector from the Promicro and solder it directly to a unified daughterboard, that's also why the Promicro cutout may not fit with the USB connector still on the PCB. (I should really write up some documentation on that ^^)

## PCB version
The adjusted Case files for the PCB version are currently on this repo.
